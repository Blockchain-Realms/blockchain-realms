# Blockchain Realms

Blockchan realms is a digital board game platform inspired by Dungeons & Dragons, enhanced with NFT technology. This platform transcends geographical barriers and brings together a global community of gamers, offering an immersive and customizable gaming experience like never before.

**Our game target auditory:**

1. **Existing Gamers Separated by Distance:** For seasoned players who find themselves miles apart from their gaming groups, our platform recreates the communal tabletop experience in a digital space. It allows friends and long-time gaming partners to continue their adventures seamlessly, regardless of location.

2. **New Players Without Local Communities:** Many enthusiasts are eager to delve into role-playing games but lack access to a local community. Our platform opens the door for these newcomers, providing an inclusive environment where they can easily join campaigns and connect with like-minded individuals worldwide.

**Key Features:**

1. **Dynamic NFT Heroes:** Every player begins their journey with an NFT Hero â€” a unique digital character with personalized attributes, skills embedded within the NFT itself. As players progress, their heroes evolve. Upgrades and achievements are recorded on-chain, updating the NFT to reflect new parameters. This feature not only personalizes the gaming experience but also adds intrinsic value to each NFT Hero, making them collectible and potentially tradable assets.

2. **On-Chain Dice Rolls:** To ensure transparency and fairness, all dice rolls are executed on the blockchain using solana candy machine. This means every outcome is verifiable and immutable, eliminating any possibility of tampering or bias. Players can trust that the game mechanics are consistent and that luck is truly random, enhancing the integrity of the gameplay.

3. **Monetizable Adventure Scenarios for Dungeon Masters:** Dungeon Masters are the architects of unforgettable gaming experiences. Our platform empowers them to monetize their creativity by selling custom-designed adventure scenarios on the in-game marketplace. This not only provides DMs with a new revenue stream but also enriches the platform with a diverse array of adventures, keeping the community engaged and the content fresh.
